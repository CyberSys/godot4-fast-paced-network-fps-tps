# PlayerInputCommand.ClientWorldTickDeltas field

For each input: Delta between the input world tick and the tick the server was at for that input. TODO: This may be overkill, determining an average is probably better, but for now this will give us 100% accuracy over lag compensation.

```csharp
public short[] ClientWorldTickDeltas;
```

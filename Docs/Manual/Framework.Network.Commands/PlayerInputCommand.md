# PlayerInputCommand structure

Network command to send client input to server

```csharp
public struct PlayerInputCommand : INetSerializable
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [ClientWorldTickDeltas](PlayerInputCommand/ClientWorldTickDeltas.md) | For each input: Delta between the input world tick and the tick the server was at for that input. TODO: This may be overkill, determining an average is probably better, but for now this will give us 100% accuracy over lag compensation. |
| [Inputs](PlayerInputCommand/Inputs.md) | An array of inputs, one entry for tick. Ticks are guaranteed to be contiguous. |
| [StartWorldTick](PlayerInputCommand/StartWorldTick.md) | The world tick for the first input in the array. |
| [Deserialize](PlayerInputCommand/Deserialize.md)(…) |  |
| [Serialize](PlayerInputCommand/Serialize.md)(…) |  |
